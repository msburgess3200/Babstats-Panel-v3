/* ----------------------- READ --------------------------- *
* *
* For each kill, deaths, or any other event the player *
* is given so-called rating points. The rating points *
* are used to determine player's rank. *
* *
* Example 1: *
* Player kills someone with a headshot, using CAR-15. *
* kill: 1.0 points *
* headshot: 1.0 points *
* CAR-15 kill: 0.4 points *
* We add these all together and get 2.4 rating points. *
* *
* Example 2: *
* Player dies by blowing himself. *
* death: -0.2 points *
* suicide: -0.2 points *
* In total we get -0.4 rating points *
* *
* NOTE: rating is calculated and stored into database *
* during stats import, so it is not possible to change *
* player ratings for already imported games by only *
* changing this file. You must edit this file before you *
* start stats tracking! An option to change player ratings *
* will be added at a later date. *
* *
